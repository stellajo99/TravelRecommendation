# TravelRecommendation

This is code for research in 'Personalized and Timed Travel Path Recommendation Based on GPS Data Using Deep Learning'.

## Clustering
- Requirements: Installation of Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Pandas
- For 'Clustering' folder, you can either run py file on Python IDE or run ipynb on Jupyter Notebook.
- With 'Edit_Distance_Hierarchical_Clustering' file, you can compute edit distance between string sequences and cluster them.
- With 'DBSCAN/K-Means/Hierarchical_cosine_sim' files, you can compare the results of three clustering using cosine similarities.
- With 'RelaxedLCS' file, you can get relaxed version of longest common subsequence.
- Using Jupyter Notebook is recommended, for it is convenient to see the result of the code.

## Data Processing

## LSTM
 - Requirements: Installation of Python, Tensorflow, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib
 - For 'LSTM' folder, you can either run py file on Python IDE or run ipynb on Jupyter Notebook.
 - Using Jupyter Notebook is recommended, for it is convenient to see the result of the code.
